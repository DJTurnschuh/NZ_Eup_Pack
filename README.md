# NZ_Eup_Pack üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

TayMcKenzieNZ's NZ EUP Pack containing Police, Fire and Ambulance for both MP Male and MP Female.

This pack was created with DurtyFree's [Cloth Tool](https://cloth.durty.dev), without him this would not be possible.

---------------------------------------

**Thanks for downloading and checking out my Ultimate NZ EUP Pack!**

After checking out many GTA 5 mods and FiveM servers, stumbling across NZ EUP packs that were either exclusive to the server they were on, or hidden behind a ridiculous pay wall, to then finding a few packs readily available for free but severely lacking female outfits, I decided to painstakingly take it upon myself to retexture and bring NZ Police, Fire ***and*** St Johns' Ambulance outfits, to Los Santos, all in one pack. You're welcome üòé

This pack does not replace original clothing items, but rather add them as an add-on after the latest set of DLC clothing by Rockstar. This will vary depending on your FiveM gamebuild *

# Research üè´

Upon doing some research, I stumbled across an article by [Wiki News](https://en.m.wikinews.org/wiki/Game_modified_to_match_New_Zealand) that discussed *"A New Zealand teenager's conversion of the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) video game is gaining popularity and the New Zealand Police are unhappy at their portrayal."*

I want to express to any law enforcement that I have no control over how people use these retextures in their games/servers and that much like the article says, *"If people want to start getting all legal and stuff, then I will just remove it. I don't want to offend anyone, I don't hate NZ Police"* and this was not created for any ill intent.

# Important Notice

This clothing pack was tested on gamebuild mpg9ec aka 2612 with the understanding that there are *about* 20 additional free .ymt slots to be used. If for whatever reason you crash using this pack, please read here and perhaps consider downgrading your gamebuild until Rockstar Games increases the [YMT limits](https://github.com/DurtyFree/durty-cloth-tool/wiki/YMT-game-limit-and-crash-issues) on/for future DLCs.


See my tutorial regarding [gamebuilds:](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-tuners-future-dlcs/4784977)

------------------------

# Covid Mask

You may need to adjust your character's head for the mask to fully cover it. Since the mask is covering the face, you could possibly just create a new character slot with the mask being worn, as nobody will notice the true difference between how your character looks with and without a mask.

Here is some suggestions you can make:

- Change Mother's inheritage to 0

- Mess about with cheekbone height and widths, Jawbone height and width and the nose as it may peak through

- Mess about with Head Shape Mix
