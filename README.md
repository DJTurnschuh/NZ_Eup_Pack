# NZ_Eup_Pack üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

TayMcKenzieNZ's NZ EUP Pack containing Police, Fire and Ambulance for both MP Male and MP Female.

This pack was created with DurtyFree's [Cloth Tool](https://cloth.durty.dev), without him this would not be possible.

---------------------------------------

**Thanks for downloading and checking out my Ultimate NZ EUP Pack!**

After checking out many GTA 5 mods and FiveM servers, stumbling across NZ EUP packs that were either exclusive to the server they were on, or hidden behind a ridiculous pay wall, to then finding a few packs readily available for free but severely lacking female outfits, I decided to painstakingly take it upon myself to retexture and bring NZ Police, Fire ***and*** St Johns' Ambulance outfits, to Los Santos. You're welcome üòé

---------------------------------------

# Research üè´

Upon doing some research, I stumbled across an article by [Wiki News](https://en.m.wikinews.org/wiki/Game_modified_to_match_New_Zealand) that discussed *"A New Zealand teenager's conversion of the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) video game is gaining popularity and the New Zealand Police are unhappy at their portrayal."*

I want to express to any law enforcement that I have no control over how people use these retextures in their games/servers and that much like the article says, *"If people want to start getting all legal and stuff, then I will just remove it. I don't want to offend anyone, I don't hate NZ Police"* and this was not created for any ill intent.

# Important Notice

This clothing pack was tested on gamebuild mpsecurity aka 2545 with the understanding that there are 2 additional free slots to be used, which have been taken up via using this very pack. If for whatever reason you crash using this pack, please read here and perhaps consider downgrading your gamebuild until Rockstar Games increases the [YMT limits](https://github.com/DurtyFree/durty-cloth-tool/wiki/YMT-game-limit-and-crash-issues) on/for future DLCs:

In current game version b2612 (mpg9ec), R* seems to have increased the YMT limit, we have about 20 additional free .ymt slots to be used.

See my tutorial regarding [gamebuilds:](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-tuners-future-dlcs/4784977)

# Covid Mask

You may need to adjust your character's head for the mask to fully cover it. Since the mask is covering the face, you could possibly just create a new character slot with the mask being worn, as nobody will notice the true difference between how your character looks with and without a mask.

Here is some suggestions you can make:

- Change Mother's inheritage to 0

- Mess about with cheekbone height and widths, Jawbone height and width and the nose as it may peak through

- Mess about with Head Shape Mix
